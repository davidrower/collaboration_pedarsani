These are files to be used for research in the Pedarsani group at UCSB. 

These files include a single-road network with paramterizations for CACC and ACC capable vehicles in the SUMO microscopic traffic simulator, with IIDM implemented. 

The specific build of SUMO uses files from this repository: https://github.com/ucbtrans/sumo-project 

Some notation in the platoon_functions.py file have been modified to match our notation.
